## Introduction

The AI Virtual Painter is an innovative tool that transforms your camera feed into a dynamic and interactive canvas. Leveraging advanced computer vision and hand-tracking technologies, it enables you to draw, write, or create art in real-time, making it appear as if your creations are materializing on the screen in front of you.

### Header Interaction
- Use your right hand with both the **index and middle fingers** raised to hover over the header.
- This gesture allows you to select between different tools and colors: **pink, blue, green**, or the **eraser**.

### Drawing and Erasing
- Raise only your **index finger** to draw or erase on the screen.
- The action (drawing or erasing) depends on your current selection from the header.

### Gesture Control
- Ensure that your hand gestures are clear and visible to guarantee smooth interaction.
- This will help in achieving precise drawing and erasing operations.
