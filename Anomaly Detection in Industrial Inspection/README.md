# Anomaly Prediction with Masked Data

## Description
This project is an excellent fit for applications in manufacturing and quality control, two fields that require effective computer vision (CV) solutions. The primary challenge is working with a dataset that lacks annotations, making this an unsupervised anomaly detection project. Additionally, the dataset is relatively small, containing just over 5000 high-resolution images, so implementing data augmentation strategies will be critical.

This unsupervised approach involves detecting anomalies in specialized industrial datasets, which makes it a highly valuable project for your portfolio. The dataset used for this project is the **MVTec Anomaly Detection Dataset**, a popular dataset for detecting defects in real-world industrial scenarios.

## Task Overview
- **Data Preprocessing and Masking**: Implement data augmentation and masking techniques to enhance model training given the small dataset size.
  
- **Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Model**: Develop an unsupervised machine learning model (e.g., autoencoder, isolation forest) that identifies anomalies in the industrial dataset without relying on annotations.

- **AI Module Integration**: Leverage AI techniques to interpret masked and augmented data for anomaly detection in high-resolution images.

- **Visualization**: Provide visual results showing detected anomalies on industrial images.

## Features
- Augmentation strategies applied to address the limited dataset size.
