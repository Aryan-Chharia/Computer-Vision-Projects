            <h2>1. Image Classification using Deep Learning</h2>
            <p>
                The project utilizes a pre-trained Keras model to classify different types of waste. The model has been trained on a dataset containing various categories of waste items, enabling it to predict the type of waste in real-time.

            <h2>2. Real-Time Video Processing</h2>
            <p>
                Using OpenCV, the project captures video from a webcam and processes each frame in real-time. The video feed is resized and analyzed to detect the type of waste present in the frame.

            <h2>3. Overlaying Images for Visualization</h2>
            <p>
                The classified waste images and corresponding bins are overlaid on a background image using the cvzone library. This provides a clear visualization of which bin to use for disposing of the detected waste.

            <h2>4. User Interface</h2>
            <p>
                The output display includes the webcam feed, the detected waste image, an arrow pointing to the appropriate bin, and the corresponding bin image. This user-friendly interface helps users easily identify how to dispose of waste properly.

        <section>
            <h2>5. Classification Mapping</h2>
            <p>
                The project includes a mapping of class IDs to specific waste categories and bins. This mapping ensures that the correct bin is displayed for each type of waste detected by the classifier.
