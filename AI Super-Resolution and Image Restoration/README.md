# AI-Powered Image Restoration and Enhancement Tool

## Project Description
This project aims to develop an **AI-Powered Image Restoration Tool** that revitalizes low-quality historical photos by upscaling, denoising, and adding realistic color. Using advanced deep learning techniques, it transforms degraded images into vibrant, high-quality visuals while preserving their historical context. This tool is perfect for heritage conservation, family archiving, and historical documentation.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - OpenCV: For image processing tasks
  - Pillow: For handling image files
  - PyTorch: For implementing deep learning models
  - torchvision: For image transformations and model utilities
- **Models**:
  - SRCNN (Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network): For image upscaling
  - DnCNN: For image denoising
  - Pre-trained colorization models (e.g., U-Net): For adding color to grayscale images
