# Pneumonia Detection with Deep Learning

## Overview

This project aims to build a deep learning model for the detection of pneumonia in chest X-ray images. The model is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras, leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification. The dataset used for training and evaluation includes chest X-ray images from patients with and without pneumonia.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) available on Kaggle. Please download and organize the dataset before running the project. The dataset includes subdirectories for training, validation, and testing.
