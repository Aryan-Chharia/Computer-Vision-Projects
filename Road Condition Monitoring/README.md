# Road Condition Monitor Project

## Overview
This project uses computer vision to detect road conditions such as cracks, potholes, and smooth surfaces. The model is trained on labeled images to classify road conditions, making it useful for monitoring and maintenance.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains training and test images.
- `models/`: Stores trained model checkpoints.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for development and testing.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and inference.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
