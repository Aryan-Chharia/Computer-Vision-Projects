QuizMaster! This project leverages hand gesture recognition—specifically, detecting the number of fingers held up and their movements—to answer quiz questions in real-time. 🧠💡

Key Features of QuizMaster:
✋ Finger Detection: Recognizes the number of fingers held up by the user to represent answers (e.g., 1 finger for option A, 2 fingers for option B, etc.).
🖐️ Gesture-Based Input: Detects hand movements to confirm answers, swipe to the next question, or reset options.
🧠 Interactive Quiz System: The quiz will prompt questions, and users can respond using their hand gestures instead of typing or clicking.
📊 Real-Time Processing: Uses computer vision techniques to provide real-time feedback as users hold up or move their fingers.
🎮 Fun and Engaging: A unique way to interact with a quiz system, making it both fun and educational. Perfect for gamified learning environments!
How It Works:
The model detects and tracks hand gestures (finger count and motion) via the webcam.
Based on the number of fingers and gestures, the system will match the input to predefined answers.
The system provides feedback, indicating whether the answer is correct and moves on to the next question.
A gesture-based swipe allows users to skip or move to the next question.
