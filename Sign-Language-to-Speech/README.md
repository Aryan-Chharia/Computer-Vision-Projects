# GestureVoice

A Flask application that translates hand gestures into text and speech in over 120 languages, with options for both
male and female voices. This innovative application utilizes advanced image processing techniques, a finely-tuned
deep learning model, and various natural language processing methods to ensure high accuracy and a seamless user
experience. By combining deep learning, machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision, this
project offers a state-of-the-art solution for gesture-to-speech conversion.
