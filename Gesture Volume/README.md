Control your system volume with hand gestures using computer vision and hand tracking technologies.

## Overview

![Volume-control-using hand gesture](docs/Untitledvideo-MadewithClipchamp2-ezgif.com-video-to-gif-converter.gif)

This project enables users to control system volume using intuitive hand gestures. By leveraging computer vision and hand tracking, we've created a touchless interface that adjusts volume based on the distance between your thumb and index finger. This solution enhances accessibility and provides an innovative approach to user interaction.

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3**
- **OpenCV**: For capturing video frames and image processing
- **Mediapipe**: For real-time hand detection and tracking
- **PyCaw**: For interacting with system audio settings
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and interpolation
- **Custom HandTrackingModule**: A purpose-built module for advanced hand tracking features

## Key Features

- üéÆ **Gesture-Based Volume Control**: Adjust system volume by changing the distance between thumb and index finger
- üîç **Real-time Hand Detection**: Instant hand gesture recognition using Mediapipe
- üìä **Smooth Transition**: Optimized gesture recognition for fluid volume adjustments
- üõ†Ô∏è **Custom HandTrackingModule**: Enhanced capabilities for finger tracking and gesture recognition

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Computer with a webcam
- Python 3.x installed

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gesture-volume-control.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd gesture-volume-control
   ```

3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Tool

1. Start the application:
   ```bash
   python VolumeControl.py
   ```

2. Use hand gestures to control volume:
   - Bring thumb and index finger closer for lower volume
   - Move them apart for higher volume

3. Press 'Esc' to exit the application

## How it Works

1. The webcam detects your hand in real-time
2. Position your hand in front of the camera
3. Adjust volume by changing thumb-index finger distance:
   - Closer = Lower volume
   - Wider = Higher volume
4. On-screen display shows current volume percentage

## Custom HandTrackingModule

Our custom-built module enhances Mediapipe functionality with:
- Precise hand landmark detection
- Real-time distance calculation between fingers
- Specialized gesture recognition for volume control

## Applications

- **Accessibility**: Touchless control for users with mobility challenges
- **Hands-Free Environments**: Ideal for presentations or cooking scenarios
- **Innovation**: Stepping stone for future gesture-based interfaces
