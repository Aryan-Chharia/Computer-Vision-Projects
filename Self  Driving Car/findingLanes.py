    # of discrete pixels. Each of the pixels for a 
    # grayscale image is represented by a single number
    # that discribes the brightness of the pixel. For the 
    # sake of example, how do we smooth in the following 
    # image? We modify the value of a pixel with the average
    # value of the pixel intensities around it. Averaging out
    # out the pixels in the image to reduce noise will be 
    # done with the kernel (5x5). Each element within the
    # kernel contain gaussian values.

    # between adjacent pixels in the image. The change in
    # brightness over a series of pixels is the gradient.

    # small gradient is a shallow change. We first establish
