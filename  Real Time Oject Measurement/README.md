# Oject Measurement in Real Time using OpenCV

This Project demonstrates how to use OpenCV to create a program where you can use an external video capture device such as your webcam to measure multiple objects' width and lenght in real time.

This is a simplified version, therefore you need to use an A4 paper as a base to put the objects on in order for this to work.
In order to understand how it works you can play around the code with the image I uploaded with.
After that you can enable the webcam option and use it in real time.

From the visual/image it detects and scrapes the A4 paper.
Then from the contour of it, it decides the borders of the objects.
Since it knows the size of an A4 paper, it finds the measurements of the objects.

This is the screenshot of how it looks.
