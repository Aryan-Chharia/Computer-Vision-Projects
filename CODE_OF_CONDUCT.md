# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- **Respectful Communication:** Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- **Open-Mindedness:** Approaching discussions and decisions with an open mind.
- **Inclusivity:** Making an effort to include and welcome diverse perspectives.
- **Constructive Feedback:** Providing and receiving feedback graciously.
- **Graceful Acceptance of Responsibility:** Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- **Harassment:** Any form of harassment or offensive behavior, whether verbal, written, or physical.
- **Disrespectful Conduct:** Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following.
- **Inappropriate Language:** Any language or content that is unwelcome or offensive.
- **Unwelcome Advances:** Unwelcome sexual attention or physical contact.
- **Discrimination:** Discrimination based on personal characteristics or background.
- **Disruptive Behavior:** Sustained disruption of discussion or events.

## Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project owner. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All project team members are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the projectâ€™s leadership.
