# Contour Detection in an Image
This project showcases how to detect contours in an image using Python and OpenCV. Contours are useful for analyzing shapes and detecting objects within images. The program identifies contours in an image, highlights them, and labels the coordinates of key points.

## Features
Binary Image Conversion: Converts a grayscale image to a binary image for easier contour detection.
Contour Detection: Identifies contours within the image using OpenCV's contour-finding functionality.
Polygon Approximation: Simplifies the contours to polygonal shapes for more efficient processing.
Coordinate Display: Marks and labels the coordinates of detected contour points on the image, identifying the topmost point as the "Arrow tip."
Interactive Visualization: Displays the resulting image with highlighted contours and labeled coordinates.
## Installation
Clone or download the project files to your local machine.

Ensure Python and necessary libraries are installed by running the following:

Python 3.x
OpenCV
NumPy

## Usage
Place the image you want to analyze in the same directory as the script.
Execute the script, which will process the image and display the contours.
The program will display the image with contours highlighted and coordinates labeled on key points.
## How It Works
Image Reading: The input image is read in both color and grayscale formats.
Thresholding: The grayscale image is converted into a binary image, which simplifies the detection of edges and contours.
Contour Detection: The program identifies the contours of objects in the binary image.
Polygon Approximation: The contours are approximated to polygons to reduce the number of points and simplify further analysis.
Coordinate Labeling: The program labels key coordinates on the contour, marking the topmost point as the "Arrow tip".
Display Results: The output image is displayed with the contours and coordinates.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to use OpenCV for detecting and visualizing contours in images. The approach can be applied in various computer vision applications, including object detection, shape analysis, and edge detection.
