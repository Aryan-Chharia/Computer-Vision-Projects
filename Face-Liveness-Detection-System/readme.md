# Face Liveness Detection System 👤💻

This project implements a Face Liveness Detection System using profile detection and blink detection techniques. The system is designed to verify whether a person is physically present during the authentication process by analyzing facial features and eye blinks. 🔍

## Methodology 🛠️

The system employs the following methodologies:

1. **Profile Detection** 📸:
   - The system utilizes Haar Cascade classifiers to detect frontal and profile faces. This helps in determining whether the user is facing the camera properly.
   - The classifiers are loaded from XML files that contain pre-trained models.

2. **Blink Detection** 👁️:
   - Dlib's shape predictor is used to detect eye landmarks, allowing the calculation of the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR).
   - If the EAR falls below a certain threshold, the system counts it as a blink. The system requires a specific number of blinks to confirm that the user is alive.

3. **User Instructions** 🗣️:
   - The user is instructed to turn left or right and to blink their eyes as prompted.
   - If the conditions of turning and blinking are satisfied within the specified limits, the system declares the liveness detection as successful; otherwise, it fails.

## Requirements 📋
