# Description

The Face Recognition System is a real-time application designed to detect, recognize faces, and track attendance. Using a combination of the Ultralytics YOLO model for face detection and the face_recognition library for embedding extraction, the system compares detected faces against a labeled dataset of known individuals for identification. An integrated attendance feature automatically marks the presence of recognized individuals, making the system suitable for use in environments such as schools, offices, or events. The project is ideal for real-time surveillance, access control, and automated attendance tracking, offering efficient face detection and recognition in both static and dynamic environments.

# Steps to run the project:

1) Create a virtual environment.
