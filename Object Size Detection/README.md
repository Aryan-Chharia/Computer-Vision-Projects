# Object Size Detection

This Project creates an app where users can upload an image to measure the size of objects in it. After uploading, the app detects objects, measures their height and width based on a reference size, and displays the image with dimensions marked on each object. It also shows the total number of objects found and lists each objectâ€™s size.
