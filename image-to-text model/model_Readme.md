Image-to-Text Model
This project implements an image-to-text model using the BLIP (Bootstrapped Language-Image Pre-training) model. It allows users to input an image (via URL), and the model generates both conditional and unconditional captions describing the content of the image.

1)Introduction

The Image-to-Text Model leverages the BLIP model to generate captions for images. The model can generate captions in two modes:

Conditional Captions: A description generated with an initial prompt.
Unconditional Captions: A description generated without any prompt.
The model is useful for various tasks, such as:

Automatic image annotation.
Assisting visually impaired individuals by describing images.
Image-based content generation.

2)Features

Conditional Captioning: Generates a caption with the context of a prompt (e.g., "a photography of ...").
Unconditional Captioning: Generates a general caption for the image without a prompt.
Streamlit Web App: Easy-to-use web interface for uploading images and generating captions.
Hugging Face Transformers: Uses the Salesforce BLIP model for robust image-caption generation.

3)Installation

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/BhavyaFattania/Computer-Vision-Projects.git

Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
Install the required dependencies:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Install additional dependencies if required for Streamlit:

Copy code
pip install streamlit
Usage
Running the Streamlit App
Start the Streamlit web app:

Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Access the app at http://localhost:8501. Input an image URL to generate captions.

Examples
Here is an example of what the model outputs:

Input
Image URL: https://example.com/sample_image.jpg
